                                        <p>Space gems known as extraterrestrial peridots are derived from a very special
                                            kind of meteorite called a pallastite. Out of more than 40,000 known meteorites,
                                            only about 60 are pallasites.</p>
                                        <p>Pallasites are arguably the most beautiful of meteorites, with a silvery alloy of
                                            nickel and iron embaying beautiful, yellow-green, large crystals of olivine. It’s
                                            from within these crystals of olivine that gem-quality extraterrestrial peridots
                                            are cut. A backlit cross-section of a pallasite meteorite is shown here: </p>

                                        <h2>Are these space gems officially recognized?</h2>
                                        <p>Yes! The nonprofit Gemological Institute of America (GIA) recognizes and certifies
                                            «pallasitic peridot» that is «extraterrestrial in origin». Extraterrestrial peridot
                                            is different in composition  from any known terrestrial peridot.</p>

                                        <h2>Where do pallasite meteorites come from?</h2>
                                        <p>Pallasites originally formed near the core-mantle boundary of large asteroids, so
                                            their metal comes from the asteroid’s core and their olivine from the asteroid’s
                                            mantle. Relatively soon afterwards, geologically speaking, their host asteroid
                                            collided with another large asteroid, creating lots of new asteroids. Most of
                                            these new asteroids were made of either metal or rock, with only a precious few
                                            containing both. </p>
                                        <p>Billions of years later, one of these rare metal-crystal asteroids was struck by
                                            a smaller bolide, ejecting small pieces of it to space. A few of these small
                                            pieces found their way to Earth, and were either seen fall or, more commonly,
                                            found much later. Sometimes they’re found by government-funded search teams such
                                            as ANSMET, but more often, by private citizens, and are sold on the open market.</p>
                                        <h2>How would I know if they are authentic?</h2>
                                        <p>Each piece of jewelry you buy will be accompanied by a certificate of authenticity
                                            from the Gemological Institute of America (GIA), an internationally-recognized
                                            non-profit gem research institute. The certificate will state that the stone has
                                            been analyzed by GIA labs and conclusively identified as a «pallasitic peridot,
                                            extraterrestrial in origin».</p>

                                        <p>Older than the age of the Earth! They formed inside large asteroids about 4.57
                                            billion years ago, when the Earth was still a ball of molten rock and iron. </p>

                                        <p>Why are they so expensive?</p>
                                        <h2>Just how rare are they?</h2>
                                        <p>The price of extraterrestrial peridot is set by its true scarcity, as opposed to
                                            artificially inflated prices for certain other gemstones.</p>
                                        <h2>Why are they better than diamonds?</h2>
                                        <p>Extraterrestrial peridots are many times older than diamonds, and formed inside
                                            big asteroids before there was even an Earth. Diamonds formed from decomposing
                                            organic matter subjected to high temperatures and pressures. Extraterrestrial
                                            peridots are better symbols of true eternity than diamonds, which also happen

                                            <p>Space gems known as extraterrestrial peridots are derived from a very special
                                                kind of meteorite called a pallastite. Out of more than 40,000 known meteorites,
                                                only about 60 are pallasites.</p>
                                            <p>Pallasites are arguably the most beautiful of meteorites, with a silvery alloy of
                                                nickel and iron embaying beautiful, yellow-green, large crystals of olivine. It’s
                                                from within these crystals of olivine that gem-quality extraterrestrial peridots
                                                are cut. A backlit cross-section of a pallasite meteorite is shown here: </p>

                                        <div>
                                            <p>Yes! The nonprofit Gemological Institute of America (GIA) recognizes and certifies
                                                «pallasitic peridot» that is «extraterrestrial in origin». Extraterrestrial peridot
                                                is different in composition  from any known terrestrial peridot.</p>

                                        <h2>Where do pallasite meteorites come from?</h2>
                                        <div>
                                            <p>Pallasites originally formed near the core-mantle boundary of large asteroids, so
                                                their metal comes from the asteroid’s core and their olivine from the asteroid’s
                                                mantle. Relatively soon afterwards, geologically speaking, their host asteroid
                                                collided with another large asteroid, creating lots of new asteroids. Most of
                                                these new asteroids were made of either metal or rock, with only a precious few
                                                containing both. </p>
                                            <p>Billions of years later, one of these rare metal-crystal asteroids was struck by
                                                a smaller bolide, ejecting small pieces of it to space. A few of these small
                                                pieces found their way to Earth, and were either seen fall or, more commonly,
                                                found much later. Sometimes they’re found by government-funded search teams such
                                                as ANSMET, but more often, by private citizens, and are sold on the open market.</p>

                                            <p>Each piece of jewelry you buy will be accompanied by a certificate of authenticity
                                                from the Gemological Institute of America (GIA), an internationally-recognized
                                                non-profit gem research institute. The certificate will state that the stone has
                                                been analyzed by GIA labs and conclusively identified as a «pallasitic peridot,

                                            <p>Older than the age of the Earth! They formed inside large asteroids about 4.57
                                                billion years ago, when the Earth was still a ball of molten rock and iron. </p>

                                            <p>The price of extraterrestrial peridot is set by its true scarcity, as opposed to

                                        <div>
                                            <p>Extraterrestrial peridots are many times older than diamonds, and formed inside
                                                big asteroids before there was even an Earth. Diamonds formed from decomposing
                                                organic matter subjected to high temperatures and pressures. Extraterrestrial
                                                peridots are better symbols of true eternity than diamonds, which also happen
                                                to be thermodynamically unstable and certainly aren’t “forever”. Plus, the supply
