                                                <p>When you add an item to your shopping bag, you may either continue shopping or proceed
                                                    to the checkout. If you are not logged in when proceeding to the checkout, you will
                                                    be prompted to do so. Checkout involves 4 simple steps: Billing, Shipping, Payment
                                                    and Order Confirmation.</p>
                                                <p>Once we have received your order, you will receive an email acknowledging the details
                                                    of your order. This email is not an order confirmation but rather recognition that we
                                                    have received your requested order.</p>
                                                <p>ONCE AN ORDER HAS BEEN PLACED, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MODIFY OR CANCEL YOUR ORDER. We
                                                    will do everything we can, but once production has started, we will only be able to
                                                    issue refunds minus expenses sustained. We reserve the right to decline your order
                                                    in the event that we are unable to obtain authorization for payment</p>

                                                    weeks to make your item to order. This ensures its uniqueness. We guarantee delivery
                                                    within 10 weeks, and offer either a full refund or a 25% discount if we fail to deliver
